### Professional Self-Assessment

My name is Brock O'Malley and I started my jounrey of pursuing a Computer Science bachelor degree here at SNHU in January 2023. Now that I am near the end of my journey I can now look back on my time here and see how I have changed and the skills that I have built along the way. 

With my classes at SNHU being completely online it pushed me to become more indepenent and to not allow myself to procrastinate like I may have in my earlier years as no one would be there to push me to hit deadlines. The classes also allowed me to learn how to communicate in a different format than I usually would with other students. This is due to the weekly discussion posts that I would engage in or the occasional class where we had a group project. There is a different form of collaboration needed when purely interacting online with each other. It's a skill you can develop overtime as you need to be clearer online or form your thoughts in ways that couldn't easily be misunderstood. I believe this is turn has helped me now in my personal life and career as my current job and company I work for has me interacting with my co workers almost 100% remotely. This was an easy transition for me to make due to my experience here over the past couple of years. Some may not think it but being able to write professional emails is a skill and can be a difference maker in how people see and think of you within your career.

### Artifact
The artifact that I used for all three enhancements was a text based Python game I made early on here at my time at SNHU. It is a very simple game that requires the player to traverse the different rooms of the map and find the items within each before they can go on to fight the dragon. If the player finds the dragon before finding all six of the items then they lose the game. Due to it being one of the first things I wrote in Python there are many changes that need to be made to have it fit best coding practices, be secure, and be engaging. The game in it's original state is not very engaging after you have played it a few times. This is due to nothing driving you further once you have beat it once.


### Software Design and Engineering - First Enhancement
For the first enhancement I mainly focused on making the codebase more object oriented. I did this by breaking it down into 4 seperate classes player, room, game and mongoDHhandler. Each of which has various functions inside that allow the game to run. I also wanted to make the game more enjoyable and engaging I did within this enahancement in combination with the second by adding in timed runs which allows the player to strive for faster times once they first beat the game.

### Data Structure - Second Enhancement
The second enhancement that I made to the game was implement a index data structure that woudl track timed runs. I did this in combination with having the user input a name so that their scores at the end of a succesful run can be tracked and seen on the leaderboard if it is quick enough. The index itself lives within the MongoDB database that I will cover in the next enhancement section.
